## Regularized Losses (rloss) for Weakly-supervised CNN Segmentation

<span align="center"><img src="teaser.png" alt="" width="800"/></span>

To train CNN for semantic segmentation using weak-supervision (e.g. scribbles), we propose regularized loss framework.
The loss have two parts, partial cross-entropy (pCE) loss over scribbles and regularization loss e.g. DenseCRF.
